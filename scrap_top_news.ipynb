All of our proposals have received a positive response from the Russian side. I am fully satisfied with my discussions,\" Rajnath Singh added.The Defence Minister did not name any specific weapons system but reports suggest that India is urging Russia to expedite the delivery that has been delayed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. India has made some payments but the delivery was initially expected only by December 2021.Rajnath Singh also described India-Russia relations as a \"strategic partnership\".\"Our defence relationship is one of its important pillars. I had an opportunity to review our defence relationship with Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov and I thank him for the honour of visiting me in this hotel, despite the restrictions of the pandemic.

The reports are not true,\" sources in the Ministry of Defence in New Delhi clarified.Rajnath Singh also said that he is happy to visit Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Ministry of Defence to attend the 75th Anniversary of the Victory Day Parade which is a most auspicious occasion for Russia and the whole world. \"Indian soldiers participated in the war effort in the millions and suffered immense causalities. Many of them were part of the war efforts to providing assistance to the Soviet Army,\" Singh told reporters.He further added how it is a great honor that an Indian Military contingent will be marching in the Red Square on June 24, a sign of everlasting friendship between the armed forces of both India and Russia.\"My visit to Moscow is the first foreign visit from India of an official delegation after the COVID pandemic. This is a sign of our special friendship. Despite all the difficulties of the pandemic, our bilateral relations are keeping good contacts at various levels,\" Rajnath Singh said.The defence minister went further to state that India is looking forward to hosting President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this year.Earlier on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar had discussions with his counterpart, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Fomin.\"I can say with confidence that the traditional friendship between India and Russia remain strong.

       " 'Right about the time the Indian Army\\'s Lt Gen Harinder Singh was holding talks with his Chinese counterpart Maj Gen Lin Liu at Ladakh\\'s Chushul-Moldo, a video clip broke the surface on social media, popping up first on Instagram, and then quickly proliferating elsewhere.The clip, just over 5 minutes long, depicted a scene that has become familiar -- Indian and Chinese army personnel sparring in a lonely forward area, throwing angry punches over territorial transgressions. While the precise details of the video remained unknown yesterday, India Today TV has learnt that it is from this month in North Sikkim.#IndiaChinaFaceOff | India-China video war peaks; new brawl video surfaces. @GauravCSawant joins in with more details.#5iveLive with @ShivAroor LIVE at https://t.co/4fqxBVUizL pic.twitter.com/6hQmd4xs0J— IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) June 22, 2020\\nWhile there remains no categorical confirmation, multiple sources say the video is from the base of the 22,000-feet high Chomo Yummo mountain in North Sikkim, which sits practically on the International Border.Note, the border between the state of Sikkim and Tibet is a \\'delineated\\' border, rather than a perceptually disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) like in Ladakh. Chomo Yummo is a popular feature with Indian Army mountaineers, with regular expeditions organised to its peak. Chomo Yummo is just 6 km away from Naku La, where troops on both sides were involved in a considerably more violent brawl on May 9. While the June fisticuffs show an altercation between just 20-30 men at most, the May 9 brawl involved over 150 men, with injuries inflicted on both sides. The May 9 incident itself came three days after a similar fistfight on the banks of the Pangong Tso in faraway Ladakh.The latest altercation appears to be a clash between two patrols, including officers from both sides. After starting off with calls from both sides to \\'go back\\', things quickly escalate into fisticuffs, with men on both sides egging their videographers to keep the camera rolling. An Indian soldier speaking to an Indian officer, likely a Captain or Major, is seen abruptly and violently interrupted by a Chinese officer, who is then beaten back. Things calm down again, before erupting again in a flurry of punches, headlocks.One part of the video that found unsurprising traction on social media is a moment when the Indian Army videographer turning his lens towards a pair of Chinese men, with the taunt, \"Uska muh dekhna... gol gappe khayega? (look at his face...will he eat golgappas?)\"But, as anyone in the Army will tell you, such incidents aren\\'t fun and games. For one thing, these are forbiddingly hostile high altitude areas, where the human body already takes a heavy beating from the weather. Coupled with simmering tensions that have stretched from Ladakh to other parts of the frontier and even to normally peaceful north Sikkim, and a video likely intended to be a psyops swipe has also revealed the extremely trying conditions in which Indian Army personnel operate.The video is the latest in a string of psychological operations hits from both sides since tensions began in Ladakh. Videos have so far emerged of brawls on the shores of Pangong Tso, Indian teams forcing Chinese teams to reverse their tracks in an unspecified Ladakh location, and a still photograph of apparently injured Indian soldiers on the banks of the Pangong Lake.Clearer and clearer that the June 15 bloodbath in Galwan was not spontaneous, but was 100% Chinese premeditated. Spontaneous clashes between India-China troops have never resulted in death or even serious injury, for instance this most recent one from late May in Pangong: pic.twitter.com/0xR1HzEc74— Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) June 17, 2020As the huge trust deficit between India and China post the Galwan Valley clash ensures an extended period of uncertainty at the border and Line of Control, expect the information battlefield to be a regular feed.

Coronil was developed by Patanjali Research Institute, Haridwar in collaboration with National Institute of Medical Science (NIMS), Jaipur.Speaking to India Today TV, Dr Anurag Tomar, Director, NIMS said that his institute was involved in the research for coronil but all permissions and licenses were sourced by Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.\"I consider it a great breakthrough. While several countries were trying to find a cure, Patanjali has done it,\" Dr Anurag Tomar said.Dr Tomar said that the trial for coronil was conducted at the National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur.\"We had more than 300 coronavirus patients. The medicine was tested on some of the patients at the NIMS centre in Jaipur. The success rate of tests of coronil was 100 per cent. While 69 per cent of patients were cured in three days, 100 per cent patients were cured in seven days,\" Dr Anurag Tomar said, adding that there are no side-effects of coronil as it is an ayurvedic medicine.He, however, added that NIMS was not involved in the process of license procurement. \"All clearances were taken by Patanjali. We did not want any legal hassles,\" Dr Tomar said.Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev has claimed that his ayurvedic brand Patanjali\\'s new medicine coronil can cure Covid-19. At a press conference held at Patanjali headquarter in Haridwar, Ramdev said that Coronil has been tested in a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial on Covid-19 patients.The Yoga guru claimed that coronil was the first Ayurvedic-clinically controlled, research, evidence and trial based medicine for Covid-19.At the presser, coronil was marketed as part of a corona kit, also comprising of an immunity booster nasal drop - Anu Tel and an ayurvedic remedy for cough, cold and fever - swasari. Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev said that the kit has received the license as medicine and recommended its use for the cure as well as prevention of Covid-19.However, the AYUSH Ministry has distanced itself from the medicine and has asked Patanjali to stop all promotions till the claims have been verified.Read | Covid-19: Patanjali launches Ayurvedic drug Coronil, Ramdev claims 100% resultsRead | Coronil: ICMR, AYUSH Ministry distance themselves from Patanjali\\'s cure for coronavirusRead | Patanjali\\'s coronavirus medicine kit to ',\n",
       " 'Former captain Sunil Gavaskar has drawn similarities between Virat Kohli and Viv Richards, saying that the current Indian skipper\\'s batting is very similar to that of the West Indies legend.Virat Kohli is the only batsman in the world who averages over 50 in all three formats of the game. Viv Richards meanwhile, is considered to be one of the greatest batsmen ever to play the sport.Talking abut the similarities between the two, Gavaskar said Kohli is the best batsman in the world because of his shot-making ability.\"It was very difficult to keep Viv Richards quiet when he was at the crease.\"Similarly, if you look at Virat Kohli’s batting today, in the same ball and same line, he will use his top hand and score a boundary towards the extra cover region and will use the bottom hand and score a boundary towards the mid-on and mid-wicket region.\"That’s why Virat Kohli is considered as the No. 1 player because he bats exactly like Viv Richards. Earlier, Gundappa Vishwanath, VVS Laxman used to bat like this,” Gavaskar said on Star Sports\\' show ‘Winning the Cup -- 1983’.Interestingly, former Australia captain Ian Chappell had also compared Kohli\\'s batting with that of Richards last month and called the Indian the best all-format batsman in the current generation.\"The best short-form player in the time I played was Viv Richards, and he just played normal cricket shots but he placed the ball so well he was able to score at a very fast rate. And Kohli\\'s the same. He plays traditional cricket shots, and he plays them really well.\"Of that group (including Steve Smith, Kane Williamson, Joe Root), Kohli is the best in all three forms. That\\'s unquestionable. His record in all three forms is quite unbelievable, particularly his record in the shorter forms,\" Chappell said on \\'The RK Show\\', which is hosted by Radhakrishnan Sreenivasan on YouTube.Chappell said Kohli\\'s fitness also makes him stand apart from his contemporaries.\"The other thing that stands out about Kohli is his fitness and running between the wickets.

       " 'As Indian and Chinese armies have agreed to disengage after 11-hour dialogue between top military commanders from both sides, sources said the exercise will be carried out in a staggered manner and could still take months before normalcy returns in Ladakh.The Corps Commander-level talks between India and China were held on Monday at Moldo - on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control, on China’s request. The meet was described as \"cordial\" and \"positive\" discussions held in a \"constructive atmosphere\". At the end of the meet, the two armies agreed to disengage and withdraw troops from the forward posts along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.Sources said the disengagement is aimed at de-induction of troops, artillery and armour and will be done in a phased manner.More discussions at local commander levelTo reach on the final consensus on the terms of phased disengagement, more discussions at the field commander level will take place.Places, where there has been no friction, will be part of the de-escalation plan in the initial stages.\"There was a mutual consensus to disengage. Modalities for disengagement from all friction areas in Eastern Ladakh were discussed and will be taken forward by both sides,\" the army said.Pangong and Galwan clash site big challenges The challenge will be in Galwan where the recent clash took place on June 15 where 20 Indian soldiers died. While there were casualties on the Chinese side they have not confirmed the numbers.The other big hurdle could be the Pangong Lake, the original flashpoint that triggered the long-standing tussle between the two armies since the faceoff on the northern bank of the lake on May 5.Sources say the de-escalation at Pangong Tso will be most critical for calm to return in eastern Ladakh.Not only have the Chinese come and camped in big numbers on the northern bank of the lake, enhanced their fortifications, observation posts and troop deployment between Finger 4 and Finger 8 that was considered a grey zone even though India claims territory till Finger 8.\"It remains to be seen how the roadmap for disengagement will be drawn out by both armies,\" said an official.Will India’s demand for restoration of status quo be met?India has once again demanded the restoration of the status quo before the May 5 faceoff at Pangong Tso.This means China will have to retreat from Finger 4, which has been under India’s control and also remove their fortifications, bunkers and observations posts between Finger 4 and Finger 8.In the June 6 meeting, between the Corps Commanders, a similar decision was held but things did not translate into actions as China failed to honour its commitment of troop withdrawal, leading to the violent clash on June 15 night between Indian and Chinese troops.

The pandemic continues to take lives, to have a serious negative impact on world politics and the economy. The pandemic has demonstrated the unprecedented interconnectedness of the international community. It is impossible to sit aside, to isolate oneself from cross-border problems.\"While foreign ministers of Russia, India and China discussed the pandemic, the need to ensure \"multilateralism\" and UN reforms were also discussed apart from the fact that the three countries have been active participants in \"shaping the global agenda\".In his opening remarks, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said, \"This special meeting reiterates our belief in the time-tested principles of international relations. But the challenge today is not just one of concepts and norms, but equally of their practice. The leading voices of the world must be exemplars in every way. Respecting international law, recognizing the legitimate interests of partners, supporting multilateralism and promoting common good is the only way of building a durable world order.\"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who hosted the event, held a press conference after the meet. Lavrov said, \"Today, we talked of probable reforms of the United Nations and India is a strong nominee to become a permanent member of UN Security Council and we support India\\'s candidacy. We believe it can become a full-fledged member of the Security Council.\"Responding to a question on the India-China stand-off, Sergei Lavrov said, \"I don\\'t think India and China need any help from outside. I don\\'t think they need to be helped, especially when it comes to country issues. They can solve them on their own,\" adding, \"This means recent events.\"\"New Delhi and Beijing have shown a commitment to a peaceful resolution. They started meetings at the level of defence officers and foreign ministers and neither has made any statement to indicate either will pursue non-diplomatic solutions,\" Lavrov told reporters.The meeting comes on the eve of the Victory Day Parade in Moscow which will see participation from the Indian side as well. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, already in Russia, will attend the parade in which a 75-member contingent of Indian forces will also take part.Thank FM Sergei Lavrov for convening the Russia-India-China (RIC) Meeting of Foreign Ministers today.

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) June 23, 2020\\nThe special RIC meeting was held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of the Second World War, as well as the foundation of the United Nations.\"The victory over Nazism and Fascism was achieved through sacrifices across many theatres by many countries. India made a significant contribution, with 2.3 million of its citizens under arms and 14 million more participating in war production. If Indian personnel were conferred the Order of the Red Star, the medical mission led by Dr Kotnis was a legend in China,\" EAM Dr S Jaishankar said as he hailed India\\'s contributions in the Second World War.\"When the victors met to fashion the ensuing global order, the political circumstances of that era did not give India due recognition. This historical injustice has stood uncorrected for the last 75 years, even as the world has changed,\" Jaishankar added, seeking to \"rectify\" the past and accord the importance and space India deserves in the new, ever-changing world order.READ | Russia will remain neutral when it comes to India and China: ExpertALSO READ | Claims that 40 PLA soldiers died in Galwan Valley clash is ‘fake news’: Chinese Foreign MinistryWATCH | India-China conflict: Which way will Moscow sway?window._ttCc = ',\n",
       " 'Sushant Singh Rajput\\'s death sent a shockwave across the nation. The actor died by suicide on June 14. His untimely death has raised questions on the Hindi film industry\\'s treatment of young actors from outside. Netizens have called out Bollywood\\'s biggies for nepotism, favouritism and bullying.Now, Irrfan\\'s son Babil, has penned a note, urging people to fight against the discrimination in the film industry without using Sushant\\'s death to further their own agenda.He shared pictures of Irrfan and Sushant Singh Rajput and wrote, \"It’s still not settling in. We’ve lost two very sincere people and sincerity is key in our spiritual journey, thus it comes as an unbelievable shock, the way Sushant has departed. Naturally, we have descended into pinning the blame on something or someone, which in itself is the most futile act because to find peace by playing the blame game is not honest peace, it is a fleeting reflection of a lie. (sic).\"He added, \"I urge you to not blame someone or something for this incredibly unfortunate happening, I urge you to accept that life is filled with leg spin deliveries bouncing off spin with no apparent explanation or understanding provided, I urge you to stop investigating the reason because it only brings more despair to the people intimately suffering the loss. (sic).\"In the post, Babil further said that instead of speculating on reasons behind Sushant\\'s death, people should learn from both him and Irrfan.He said, \"Instead we must celebrate the evolution of these sincere men and let their wisdom manifest in our own journeys in some way, hoping to keep little lanterns of their memories ignited in our sensitive souls. I’m saying stand up for what’s right without using Sushant’s demise as an excuse, if you want to rebel against nepotism, do so, but don’t use Sushant as a reason to why you’re doing so now. Stand up for what’s right regardless anyway in any case. (And it would and should be my fight to prove to the audience that I deserve a shot.)
